PHS UI Test
Rudradeb Chatterjee

Unity 6 (6000.0.34f1) has been used


-----------------------------------------------------------
There are 5 Main Folder consisting all the major data in it.

Assets - Consists all the Sprites in it (In ideal situation i would have created a sub-folder inside the Assets folder, but since this project just to test my skills and is limited to only Sprites for assets so i have added sprites directly into it.)

Animations -Consists all the animation clips in it that have been used for making animated buttons.

Scenes - All the scenes are in this folder

Scripts - Consits two sub-folders, one contains all the scripts for the buttons, and the other consists all the general scripts(if any).

SFX - Consists of all the sfx files in it (including the bg music which is an original piece played and composed by me).

Kindly ignore the other folders.....!!

------------------------------------------------------------

* You can start the game and hover on the buttons to view the animations and visual effects.

* All the buttons are scripted to do a function so you can press on any button to see a result, additionally you can click on the footer menu buttons to slide to different menu screens.

* In the Settings menu, there is a working volume slider that can be dragged to increase or decrease the music volume (drag it from the bottom part of the handle).

* The Start button takes you to an empty map just to show an exaple of a sene changing UI button so PRESS IT ONLY WHEN you are done viewing everything.
